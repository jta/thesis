\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

The work documented herein was made possible by my advisors along the way, formal or otherwise: Manuel Ricardo and Filipe Abrantes for setting me on this path, George Pavlou and Miguel Rio for drafting directions which in my youth and to my chagrin I too often left unheeded, and Kensuke Fukuda for providing me with an eventful detour.

%The ensuing comedy of errors would not have been possible without the following cast: Raul Landa, Michio Honda and Richard Clegg as co-conspirators; 
%the entirety of NSRL as pub patrons; Pedro Cuba, Kalie Howse and Edgar Santos for the intermission; the Portuguese government as deus ex machina.
%For support in absentia : my parents, my family, Catarina Felix, Pedro Ribeiro, Nuno Salta.
