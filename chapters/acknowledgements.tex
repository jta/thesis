The work documented herein was made possible by my advisors along the way, formal or otherwise: Manuel Ricardo and Filipe Abrantes for inadvertently setting me on this path, George Pavlou and Miguel Rio for drafting directions which in my youth and to my chagrin I too often left unheeded, and Kensuke Fukuda for providing me with an eventful detour.

The ensuing comedy of errors was funded by the Portuguese government and would not have been complete without the following cast: 
Ra\'{u}l Landa, Richard Clegg and Michio Honda as co-conspirators; 
Ioannis Psaras as proofreader;
Suksant Sae Lor, Lorenzo Saino and Marinos Charalambides as fellow destitute Hackney residents;
the entirety of NSRL for consistently getting me into the pub;
Eleni Mykoniati for repeatedly getting us out;
Pedro Cuba, Jorge Felizardo, Kalie Howse and Edgar Santos as comic relief.
For support in absentia while my mind wandered: my parents, my family, Catarina F\'{e}lix, Pedro Ribeiro, Nuno Salta.
