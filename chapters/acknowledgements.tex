The work documented herein was made possible by my advisors along the way, formal or otherwise: Manuel Ricardo and Filipe Abrantes for setting me on this path, George Pavlou and Miguel Rio for drafting directions which in my youth and to my chagrin I too often left unheeded, and Kensuke Fukuda for providing me with a detour which made it all worthwhile.

I'm equally indebted to those who made sure I didn't veer off course along the way.
