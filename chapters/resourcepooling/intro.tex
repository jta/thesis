The Internet was designed around the ability to pool shared resources. 
From an initial desire to share mainframes, resource pooling has grown to encompass statistical multiplexing within links and across paths, and is indigenous to every layer of the network stack \cite{Wischik:2008p137}. 
This chapter briefly reviews how resource pooling has evolved within the Internet architecture and proposed future directions. 
Section \ref{sec:resourcepooling:congestion} reviews how capacity is shared end-to-end, and how ensuing congestion is managed while section \ref{sec:resourcepooling:balancing} focuses on how traffic is allocated and balanced across different network paths.
