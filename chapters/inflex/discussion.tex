\section{Beyond resilience}
\label{section:inflex:discussion}

In chapter \ref{chapter:preflex}, \ac{PREFLEX} was presented primarily as an architecture for dynamic traffic management, but one in which resilience was identified as a potential benefit given sufficiently adaptive control.
In this section, the opposite approach is taken: deriving a traffic management solution from an architecture first built around resilience.

INFLEX corrected two potential shortcomings in PREFLEX.
Firstly, by eschewing the need for receiver collaboration, INFLEX is unilaterally deployable by edge domains.
Secondly, by not tying network processing to SYN packets, INFLEX is less susceptible to \ac{DOS} attacks such as SYN floods.
Thirdly, flows do not incur additional delay on flow start.
Nonetheless, no
