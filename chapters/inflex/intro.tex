\section{Beyond PREFLEX}

The obtained results are also significant in challenging some of the assumptions made in section \ref{sec:preflex} in constructing PREFLEX.
In particular, we recover three statements which warrant further consideration:

\begin{itemize}
\item{
    \textbf{Most flows may not benefit from \ac{MPTCP}.}
    This statement has largely been supported by the significant proportion of traffic in the MAWI dataset which makes no attempt to probe for more bandwidth.
    Our original deliberations however severely underestimated the inherent difficulties in deploying protocol extensions, even at the transport layer.
    The MAWI dataset demonstrates that even the deployment of innocous TCP options such as TCP Windowscale are protracted and subject to lengthy OS deployment cycles.
    While recent developments in packet I/O frameworks may yet foster efficient and flexible userspace network stacks, existing OS communities are justifiably weary of significant changes to the kernel without careful instrumentation.

\item{
    \textbf{The network has appropriated flow semantics from the transport layer.}
    PREFLEX advocated decoupling the notion of a transport flow and a network \emph{flowlet}.
    The symptoms of this dichotomy were correctly identified and entirely justified by the MAWI dataset, with many transfers being multiplexed or chunked over a same transport association.
    The extent to which these flowlets occur in practice however was surprising.
    Within PREFLEX, a packet marked as FNE would signal to the network the start of a new flowlet, allowing packets requiring further processing to be easily identified by PREFLEX routers.

\item{
    \textbf{At a small enough timescale, traffic engineering can replace resilient routing entirely.}
