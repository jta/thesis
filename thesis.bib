title = {{One More Bit is Enough}},
abstract = {Achieving efficient and fair bandwidth allocation while minimizing packet loss and bottleneck queue in high bandwidth-delay product networks has long been a daunting challenge. Existing end-to-end congestion control (e.g., TCP) and traditional congestion notification schemes (e.g., TCP+AQM/ECN) have significant limitations in achieving this goal. While the XCP protocol addresses this challenge, it requires multiple bits to encode the congestion-related information exchanged between routers and end-hosts. Unfortunately, there is no space in the IP header for these bits, and solving this problem involves a non-trivial and time-consuming standardization process. In this paper, we design and implement a simple, low-complexity protocol, called variable-structure congestion control protocol (VCP), that leverages only the existing two ECN bits for network congestion feedback, and yet achieves comparable performance to XCP, i.e., high utilization, negligible packet loss rate, low persistent queue length, and reasonable fairness. On the downside, VCP converges significantly slower to a fair allocation than XCP. We evaluate the performance of VCP using extensive ns2 simulations over a wide range of network scenarios and find that it significantly outperforms many recently-proposed TCP variants, such as HSTCP, FAST, CUBIC, etc. To gain insight into the behavior of VCP, we analyze a simplified fluid model and prove its global stability for the case of a single bottleneck shared by synchronous flows with identical round-trip times.

journal = {IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking},
title = {{Twelve Years in the Evolution of the Internet Ecosystem}},
abstract = {Our goal is to understand the evolution of the autonomous system (AS) ecosystem over the last 12 years. Instead of focusing on abstract topological properties, we classify ASs into a number of types depending on their function and business type. Furthermore, we consider the semantics of inter-AS links: customer-provider versus peering relations. We find that the available historic datasets from RouteViews and RIPE are not sufficient to infer the evolution of peering links, and so we restrict our focus to customer-provider links. Our findings highlight some important trends in the evolution of the Internet over the last 12 years and hint at what the Internet is heading toward. After an exponential increase phase until 2001, the Internet has settled into a slower exponential growth in terms of both ASs and inter-AS links. The growth is mostly due to enterprise networks and content/access providers at the periphery of the Internet. The average path length remains almost constant, mostly due to the increasing multihoming degree of transit and content/access providers. The AS types differ significantly from each other with respect to their rewiring activity; content/access providers are the most active. A few large transit providers act as ``attractors'' or ``repellers'' of customers. For many providers, strong attractiveness precedes strong repulsiveness by 3-9 months. Finally, in terms of regional growth, we find that the AS ecosystem is now larger and more dynamic in Europe than in North America.},

The solutions family currently being discussed concerns the addresses separation into locators and identifiers, LISP being one of them. Such a separation provides opportunities in terms of traffic engineering. In this paper, we propose an open and flexible solution that allows an ISP using identifier/locator separation to engineer its interdomain traffic. Our solution relies on the utilization of a service that transparently ranks paths using cost functions. We implement a prototype server and demonstrate its benefits in a LISP testbed. ER  -},

title = {{Explicit routing algorithms for Internet traffic engineering}},
abstract = {This paper considers explicit routing algorithms for Internet traffic engineering. Explicit routing is seen to be a much more capable solution for improving network utilization than the current destination-based routing and the multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) standard has made explicit routes implementable. ISP can now have fine granularity control over the traffic distribution across their backbones by carefully overlaying explicit routes over the physical network. The basic traffic engineering problem is how to set up explicit routes to meet bandwidth demands between the edge nodes of the network and at the same time to optimize the network performance. We model the traffic engineering problem as an optimization problem with the objective of minimizing congestion and maximizing potential for traffic growth. We present two mathematical formulations, one linear programming for the case of allowing demand bifurcation and one integer programming for the case of disallowing demand bifurcation. While the bifurcation case can be solved to optimality, we show that the non-bifurcation case is NP-hard. Four heuristic schemes are proposed for the non-bifurcation case, with the most sophisticated one being based on re-routing of split demands in the optimal solution of the bifurcation case. The performance of these heuristic schemes are tested in a large backbone topology. Our results show that shortest-path and minimum hop algorithms, although widely used in current routing protocols, perform poorly, white the re-routing approach performs best ER  -},

title = {{Seven Years and One Day: Sketching the Evolution of Internet Traffic}},
abstract = {This contribution aims at performing a longitudinal study of the evolution of the traffic collected every day for seven years on a trans-Pacific backbone link (the MAWI dataset). Long term characteristics are investigated both at TCP/IP layers (packet and flow attributes) and application usages. The analysis of this unique dataset provides new insights into changes in traffic statistics, notably on the persistence of Long Range Dependence, induced by the on-going increase in link bandwidth. Traffic in the MAWI dataset is subject to bandwidth changes, to congestions, and to a variety of anomalies. This allows the comparison of their impacts on the traffic statistics but at the same time significantly impairs long term evolution characterizations. To account for this difficulty, we show and explain how and why random projection (sketch) based analysis procedures provide practitioners with an efficient and robust tool to disentangle actual long term evolutions from time localized events such as anomalies and link congestions. Our central results consist in showing a strong and persistent long range dependence controlling jointly byte and packet counts. An additional study of a 24-hour trace complements the long-term results with the analysis of intraday variabilities.},

abstract = {Traffic engineering is an important mechanism for Internet network providers seeking to optimize network performance and traffic delivery. Routing optimization plays a key role in traffic engineering, finding efficient routes so as to achieve the desired network performance. In this survey we review Internet traffic engineering from the perspective of routing optimization. A taxonomy of routing algorithms in the literature is provided, dating from the advent of the TE concept in the late 1990s. We classify the algorithms into multiple dimensions: unicast/multicast, intra-/inter- domain, IP-/MPLS-based and offline/online TE schemes. In addition, we investigate some important traffic engineering issues, including robustness, TE interactions, and interoperability with overlay selfish routing. In addition to a review of existing solutions, we also point out some challenges in TE operation and important issues that are worthy of investigation in future research activities. ER  -},

title = {{Resolving Cross-Layer Conflict Between Overlay Routing and Traffic Engineering}},
abstract = {Overlay routing is known to cause undesired instability in a network by operating in a selfish manner. The objectives of overlay routing, such as optimizing end-to-end latency, are often in conflict with the objectives of traffic engineering (TE) in the native layer, which is concerned about balancing load. In our paper, we build on past research that has investigated the recurring noncooperative interaction between overlay routing and traffic engineering, and develop strategies that improve the routing performance of a particular layer with incomplete information about the other layer. In our strategies, one layer acts as a <i>leader</i> that predicts the <i>follower</i>'s reaction and undertakes countermeasures to prevent future deterioration in performance. Specifically, we propose two classes of strategies-<i>friendly</i> or <i>hostile</i>-for each layer. By simulating under different network characteristics, we show that these preemptive strategies achieve near-optimal performance for the leader and increase the overall stability of the network. Furthermore, we observe that the best performance for a particular layer is achieved only when the goals of the other layer are completely violated, thereby motivating a higher level of selfishness.

title = {{Path Selection and Multipath Congestion Control}},
abstract = {In this paper we investigate the potential benefits of coordinated congestion control for multipath data transfers, and contrast with uncoordinated control. For static random path selections, we show the worst-case throughput performance of uncoordinated control behaves as if each user had but a single path (scaling like log(log(<i>N</i>))/log(<i>N</i>) where <i>N</i> is the system size, measured in number of resources). Whereas coordinated control gives a throughput allocation bounded away from zero, improving on both uncoordinated control and on the greedy-least loaded path selection of e.g. Mitzenmacher. We then allow users to change their set of routes and introduce the notion of a Nash equilibrium. We show that with RTT bias (as in TCP Reno), uncoordinated control can lead to inefficient equilibria. With no RTT bias, both uncoordinated or coordinated Nash equilibria correspond to desirable welfare maximising states. Moreover, simple path reselection polices that shift to paths with higher net benefit can find these states. ER  -},

title = {{Interdomain traffic engineering with BGP}},
abstract = { Traffic engineering is performed by means of a set of techniques that can be used to better control the flow of packets inside an IP network. We discuss the utilization of these techniques across interdomain boundaries in the global Internet. We first analyze the characteristics of interdomain traffic on the basis of measurements from three different Internet service providers and show that a small number of sources are responsible for a large fraction of the traffic. Across interdomain boundaries, traffic engineering relies on a careful tuning of the route advertisements sent via the border gateway protocol. We explain how this tuning can be used to control the flow of incoming and outgoing traffic, and identify its limitations. ER  -},
